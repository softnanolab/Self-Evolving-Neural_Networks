In order to effectively use the algorithm, one can either use a long simulation function or just implement the standard one into their code, keeping in mind that the global lists need to be reinitialised after every simulation.
In order to effectively save models and data, one needs to specify the file path in the global folder variable (eg folder = r"filepath"). The file path decided needs to have two folders, one named "models", another one named "test_datasets". Those are the locations in which the data will be stored.
The model produced by the simulation at the end is the last model which the algorithm accepted.
